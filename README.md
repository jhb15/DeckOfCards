#### To Play Game

For this game I have used 4 buttons on the we page to allow all possible actions. These are 'Draw Cards', 'Shuffle Deck', 'Order Hand', 'Reset' and there behaviour is as follows.

>
>> **Draw Cards** - This button displays a prompt asking the user for a number of cards they want to draw.
>
>> **Shuffle Deck** - This button shuffles the cards in the deck.
>
>> **Order Hand** - This button orders the cards now drawn into the users hand.
>
>> **Reset** - This button resets everything back to the begining.
